# AddSongApp_JS_HTML_CSS
Created a simple app to add songs to a temporary table in another page  

## App index.html
1) As you are typing in the text box, the in focus features kicks in, highlighting the text box that you are typing on in blue

2) If you leave any component blank/ type only spaces, the app will highlight it in yellow and give reminder messages at the bottom

5) Added Word count and remaining word count under the "Description" Textbox.  
6) Reset button allows you to clear all the inputs, remove the yellow highlighting and also the reminder messages.  
7) Once you have successfully completed the form(by clicking submit), you will be brought to "process.html"  
Here is what a completed form should look like:
